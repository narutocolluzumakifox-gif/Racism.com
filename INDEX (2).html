      <h2 id="learnTitle">Learn — Key Ideas</h2>
      <div style="max-width:980px;margin:12px auto">
        <p><strong>Individual racism</strong> refers to personal beliefs and actions that hurt someone because of their race. This includes insults, microaggressions, and unequal treatment.</p>
        <p><strong>Systemic racism</strong> exists in institutions and systems that create unequal outcomes for different groups — in education, housing, employment, and justice.</p>
        <p><strong>Cultural racism</strong> devalues certain cultures and presents others as the default. It shows up in media, textbooks, and everyday assumptions.</p>

        <h3>Why learning helps</h3>
        <p>Education breaks stereotypes and builds empathy. Learning facts, listening to lived experiences, and reflecting on history make it easier to stand up to unfairness.</p>

        <h3>Further reading ideas</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Read personal stories and first-person accounts.</li>
          <li>Explore historical context and systemic examples.</li>
          <li>Use trusted educational sites and library resources.</li>

      <h2 id="howTitle">How to Stop Racism</h2>
      <div style="max-width:980px;margin:12px auto">
        <p>Stopping racism begins with awareness and continues through action. Below are practical, everyday steps you can take:</p>

        <ol>
          <p>Stopping racism requires long-term effort from individuals, communities, and society as a whole, and it begins with awareness. The first step is educating ourselves by understanding the history of racism, how it harms people, and why it still exists today. When people learn about different cultures, beliefs, and backgrounds, they become more open minded and less likely to judge others unfairly. Another important step is challenging stereotypes, which means refusing to believe negative ideas about groups of people based on their skin color or ethnicity. Instead, we should focus on seeing each person as an individual with their own personality, talents, and experiences. We can also help stop racism by speaking up when we witness discrimination. This does not always mean confrontation; it can simply be telling a teacher, standing by the person who was targeted, or calmly pointing out why something is wrong. Progress also happens when we create inclusive environments such as schools, workplaces, and online spaces where everyone feels safe, respected, and heard. Practicing empathy is crucial as well, because trying to understand how others feel helps us treat people with kindness and fairness. Finally, stopping racism involves reflecting on our own behavior and being willing to change. Even small actions such as using respectful language, supporting diversity, correcting misinformation, and treating everyone equally play a role. When many people make these positive choices every day, society becomes more equal, more respectful, and free from discrimination..</p>
        </ol>

        <p class="note"><strong>Reminder:</strong> Mistakes happen. Apologize, learn, and keep trying — progress is a journey.</p>

      <div style="max-width:980px;margin:12px auto">
        <p>Your willingness to be kind, to listen, and to act makes a difference. Here are concrete ways you can help:</p>
        <ul>
          <p> Every person has a meaningful role in reducing racism, and your actions, even the smallest ones, matter more than you might imagine. Your role begins with awareness—understanding how words, behaviors, and assumptions can affect others. From there, your responsibility grows through the choices you make each day: choosing respect, choosing fairness, and choosing to speak up when something feels wrong. You help create a more inclusive environment by noticing when someone is being treated unfairly, offering support, and encouraging positive conversations. Learning about different cultures and perspectives helps you avoid stereotypes and builds empathy. When you challenge harmful jokes, question unfair treatment, or simply treat everyone with dignity, you are contributing to real change. Your role isn't about being perfect, but about being willing to grow, reflect, and stand for what is right. By acting with kindness and equality, you help shape a safer, more understanding world for everyone.</P>

        <p>If you or someone else experiences racism, safety is first. These steps can help you respond and document the incident:</p>
        <ul>
         <p> Your role in preventing racism begins with understanding its impact and recognizing how everyday actions can either challenge or support unfair treatment. By choosing to treat all people with respect, you help create a more inclusive environment where everyone feels valued. Speaking up when you witness discrimination, supporting those who are targeted, and encouraging others to act fairly are meaningful ways to make a difference. Educating yourself about different cultures and perspectives also helps reduce stereotypes and promotes empathy. Even small decisions, such as using respectful language or correcting misinformation, contribute to positive change. Taking responsibility for your actions and encouraging fairness in your community strengthens the fight against racism and helps build a society based on equality and dignity for everyone.</P>

  <div style="max-width:980px;margin:12px auto;line-height:1.6;color:#223148">
    <p>If you experience or witness racism, feeling safe comes first. Below are clear steps you can follow depending on the situation.</p>

    <h3>Immediate safety</h3>
    <p>
      If you are in danger or feel threatened, move to a safe place and call your local emergency number right away.
      If the situation is not an emergency but you feel unsafe, try to get to a public area, find people who can help, or contact a trusted adult.
    </p>

    <h3>Document what happened</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Write down the date, time, and exact location of the incident.</li>
      <li>Describe clearly what was said or done and who was involved (names or descriptions).</li>
      <li>Note any witnesses and collect their contact information if possible.</li>
      <li>Save any digital evidence such as screenshots, messages, photos, or videos.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Report the incident</h3>
    <p>Where to report depends on where it happened:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>At school:</strong> Tell a teacher, counselor, or principal and share your notes.</li>
      <li><strong>At work:</strong> Contact HR, a manager, or a union representative and give them the facts.</li>
      <li><strong>Online:</strong> Use the platform's report tools and save evidence of the content.</li>
      <li><strong>Crimes or threats:</strong> Report to local police and provide your documentation.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Find support</h3>
    <p>You do not have to handle this alone. Reach out for emotional and practical help:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Talk with friends or family you trust.</li>
      <li>See a counselor or mental health professional for emotional support.</li>
      <li>Contact local community organizations, helplines, or NGOs that support victims of discrimination.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Self-care and next steps</h3>
    <p>Experiencing racism can be upsetting. Take time to rest, speak to supportive people, and do things that help you feel safe. If you want to take action later, you can:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Share your story anonymously to raise awareness (only if you feel comfortable).</li>
      <li>Join school or community groups that promote inclusion.</li>
      <li>Learn about bystander response techniques so you can help safely in future situations.</li>
    </ul>
